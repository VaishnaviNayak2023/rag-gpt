FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, known for high performance, easy development, and automatic documentation. 
It is built on standard Python type hints, which allows FastAPI to perform data validation and generate OpenAPI documentation automatically. 

FastAPI supports asynchronous programming using Python’s async/await syntax, making it suitable for high-concurrency applications. 
Developers can define endpoints, request parameters, and response models using Python classes and Pydantic schemas, 
which simplifies code maintenance and improves reliability. FastAPI also supports dependency injection, security schemes, and background tasks.

Applications of FastAPI include serving machine learning models, building microservices, developing RESTful APIs, 
and creating backend systems that handle large volumes of requests efficiently. Its combination of speed, simplicity, 
and automatic documentation makes it a preferred choice for modern Python web development.
