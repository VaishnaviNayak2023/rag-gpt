Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data. 
Inspired by the human brain, deep learning networks are capable of learning representations at multiple levels of abstraction. 

Common architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for image recognition and processing, 
and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which handle sequential data like text, audio, or time series. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and 
Transformer models, such as BERT and GPT, have further advanced natural language understanding and generation.

Deep learning requires large datasets and significant computational resources to train effectively. 
Frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras have made it easier for developers and researchers to build and deploy deep learning models. 
Applications span self-driving cars, speech recognition, language translation, medical imaging, and recommendation systems.

The success of deep learning is driven by the combination of big data, GPUs, and advanced algorithms. 
As research progresses, deep learning continues to push the boundaries of what machines can achieve, including creativity, reasoning, and understanding context in complex tasks.
