Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond Earth’s atmosphere. It contains stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and galaxies. 
The solar system consists of the Sun and its orbiting planets, with diverse environments ranging from the scorching surface of Mercury 
to the icy expanse of Neptune. 

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, helps humanity understand the universe’s origin, structure, and evolution. 
Telescopes, satellites, and space probes allow us to observe distant stars, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena. 
Space exploration has led to technological innovations, improved understanding of physics and chemistry, 
and the possibility of future colonization of other planets.
