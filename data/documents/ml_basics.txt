Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from experience and data without being explicitly programmed. 
At its core, machine learning involves creating algorithms that can detect patterns, make predictions, or take actions based on input data. 
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled datasets, where the input data is paired with correct output labels. 
Examples include spam detection in emails, credit scoring, and image classification. 
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data and aims to find underlying structures or patterns, 
such as customer segmentation or anomaly detection. Reinforcement learning is a technique where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties 
based on its actions, commonly used in robotics, game-playing AI, and autonomous vehicles.

Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, 
k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks. The choice of algorithm depends on the problem, data size, and desired accuracy. 
Machine learning has transformed industries by enabling predictive analytics, intelligent automation, and personalization at scale.
