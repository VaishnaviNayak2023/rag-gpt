Biology is the scientific study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and interactions with the environment. 
It covers diverse areas such as genetics, ecology, physiology, microbiology, and zoology. Biology helps humans understand the mechanisms of life, 
from the molecular level to complex ecosystems. 

Applications of biology include medicine, agriculture, environmental conservation, and biotechnology. 
By studying biology, humans can improve health, produce sustainable food, preserve biodiversity, 
and develop innovations such as genetic engineering and pharmaceuticals.
