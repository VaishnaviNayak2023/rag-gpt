Physics is the natural science that studies matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature. 
It explores how objects move, interact, and exchange energy, ranging from subatomic particles to the cosmos. 
Classical physics, including Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics, forms the foundation of engineering and everyday technology. 

Modern physics includes quantum mechanics and relativity, which describe phenomena at very small and very large scales. 
Physics principles are applied in technology, such as electricity generation, transportation, medical imaging, and communication systems. 
By understanding the laws of nature, physics allows humans to predict, control, and innovate in scientific and technological domains.
