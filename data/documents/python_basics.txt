Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
Python’s syntax is designed to be clear and concise, which makes it accessible to beginners while remaining powerful for experts.

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, particularly for data science and AI. 
NumPy and Pandas provide tools for numerical computations and data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, 
and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning. Python is also widely used in web development, 
with frameworks like Django and FastAPI, and in automation, scripting, and software development.

Python’s popularity stems from its community support, extensive documentation, and ability to integrate with other languages and tools. 
It has become the de facto language for AI and data science projects, enabling rapid prototyping, experimentation, and production-grade applications.
