Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, and the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions. 
Atoms, molecules, and chemical bonds are the building blocks of matter. Chemistry bridges physics and biology, explaining how substances interact and transform. 

Branches of chemistry include organic chemistry (study of carbon compounds), inorganic chemistry (study of non-carbon substances), 
analytical chemistry (measuring and analyzing substances), and physical chemistry (understanding chemical processes using physics principles). 
Chemistry has practical applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, environmental science, energy production, and food chemistry.
