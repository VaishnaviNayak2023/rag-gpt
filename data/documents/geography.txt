Geography is the study of Earth’s physical features, environments, and the relationships between people and their surroundings. 
It is divided into physical geography, which examines mountains, rivers, climate, and ecosystems, 
and human geography, which studies populations, urban development, and cultural patterns. 

Geography uses maps, satellite imagery, and spatial analysis to understand natural and human-made environments. 
It informs urban planning, disaster management, environmental conservation, and global trade. 
By studying geography, humans gain insight into how the environment affects societies and how societies impact the environment.
