Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It provides the foundation for logical reasoning, problem-solving, 
and scientific analysis. Key branches include arithmetic (basic calculations), algebra (symbolic reasoning), geometry (shapes and space), 
trigonometry (angles and relationships), and calculus (change and motion). 

Mathematics is applied in engineering, physics, economics, data science, and everyday life. It allows humans to model real-world phenomena, 
make predictions, optimize systems, and understand abstract concepts. Its universal principles make it an essential tool across disciplines.
